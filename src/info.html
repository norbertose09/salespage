            Let me tell you a bit about how mattresses are manufactured.

The most active chemical in the making of foams is Polyurethanes, this single chemical when wrongly handled is what could lead to cancer and might be responsible for the increased cancer numbers recently reported.

Polyurethanes, like all plastics, are polymers made by reacting diisocyanates (MDI and/or TDI) with a range of polyols. 

Depending on the desired end product in our case foams, chemical formulations may contain other ingredients such as catalysts, blowing agents, and possibly flame retardants. 

I know all these are big words and you might not understand any of them… 

What we’re saying is, in the process of foam manufacturing polyurethanes used are usually mixed with other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs to those in the know).

And this substance right here is the problem.

You see, many of these fake mattress manufacturers don’t care about any ethical chemical makeup and are not interested in following standard procedures in making these foams.

All they care about is how to get these foams out as quickly as possible, sell for a relatively cheaper price than the actual manufacturers and go to bed with their account balances adding more zeros.

While this is happening, the vast majority of us are unaware… all we know is, we need a mattress to lay our heads and we rush to get a mattress from just anybody down the street.

With the unethical behavior of these manufacturers, I’m sorry but they’re killing you… SLOWLY.

Many of you reading this right now might be thinking, “well, I don’t have cancer nor does anybody around me, so I’m safe”.

But are you? According to cancer research, it takes 10 - 15 years for a cancer tumor to develop or even be noticed.

So you might not believe it’s there because it’s not fully developed and you’re not diagnosed yet.

For the other small subset of you free from this terminal disease… you might be free from the cancer exposure these fake mattresses expose you to, but you’re in for a whole other plethora of problems.

Depending on the specific VOC compound, the amount or concentration of the VOC, and the duration and route of exposure, symptoms may also include memory and hearing loss, depression, fatigue, confusion, dizziness, feeling drunk or “high,” lack of coordination, chest tightness, shortness of breath, skin rashes, and cracked or bleeding skin.
 
Children exposed to elevated levels of VOCs may experience asthma symptoms.
 
All because you got mattresses you weren’t supposed to.
 
And the problem doesn’t end here in Nigeria as some others might think, it’s a global issue, and agencies around the world are figuring out ways to still fight it.
 
But you and I know, Nigeria is a place where the corrupt thrive… these fake manufacturers make billions each month from mattress sales and who do you think they’re friends with?
 
Who's going to stop them, all they care about is making as much money as they can regardless of the number of lives they’re putting in danger.
 
There’s a link I’ll share below, where you’ll see different people from around the worlds telling different stories about how their mattresses almost killed them… 
 
One of them particularly got to me.
 
How she developed cervical cancer from a bad mattress… here’s the link when you’re done reading make sure you come back to see how you can not only save yourself but also save as many people as you can…
 
https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/my-family-could-hear-scream-22798015 
 
Medical researchers noticed that in Japan, the rates of breast cancer and prostate cancer are much lower than in Western countries… a plausible reason for this difference in cancer levels could be their beds.

Also, a  lab in Atlanta analyzed several mattresses made from this (Polyurethane), and it found them to emit 61 different types of chemicals. Some of these materials were carcinogens including benzene and naphthalene… major causes of some highly terminal diseases.
 
And it seems somebody else made this exposure a while back, but as you expect it was covered up that it never got to public hands… It was first announced by Walter Bader, the author of the book “Toxic Bedrooms”. 
 
As a publication stated… ‘It is remarkable that no one is letting the public know about this information.”
 
Exactly what happens when you try to fight a billion-dollar industry that thrives from harming the lives of everyday people?
 
Having heard all this, you may be sleeping on one of these terminal machines you refer to as beds.
 
And that’s why I’m writing to you today.
